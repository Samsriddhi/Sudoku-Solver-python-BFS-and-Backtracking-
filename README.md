### Sudoku-Solver in python and its Tkinter UI

Made for SC1015 DSAI Lab, March, 2024

## Algorithms used:<br />

1.CPS and Backtracking <br />
2.BFS <br />
3.DFS
4.UCS using the number of constraints violated as the cost function <br />
5.Greedy function using Minimum Remaining Values (MRV) heuristic that selects the variable (cell) with the fewest remaining legal values. It prioritizes the variables that are likely to lead to a solution faster. <br />
6.A* search combining 4 & 5 <br />
